# Expanding the Use of Satellite Imagery with Machine Learning  

Machine Learning algorithms have proved to be a powerful tool for analyzing satellite imagery of any resolution and proving better and more nuanced insights. Presented in this repository are approaches with Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. Both methods are used with different datasets to attempt and understand how results differ with data and how these models work and interpret data. Further model evaluation and outcome will be performed.

Use cases of satellite imagery analysis include:
- argicultural, forestry, and sustainability sectors;
- understand local waterway pollution, illegal land uses, or mass migrations;
- predict wilwdefire and flood;
- predict glacier and water differences;
- crops and food predictions;
- poverty prediction;
- infrastructure and urban planning;

## Project Structure

The `Main` notebook includes all the text and research information. `Implementation` notebook has the actual code implemented and all of the examples. From `Main` there are references to guide you to the appropriate `Implementation` section.

The Datasets folder includes all relevant data used in the project. Furthermore all the dataset links and citations can be found in the `Main` notebook.
